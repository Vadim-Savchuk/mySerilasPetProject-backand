# In this repository I put the backadn part to my pet project.

## Description
I love to watch series and anime and when I watch them a lot I often forget which season or series I stopped at as the series often come out with a delay. That's why I created such a project where you can conveniently record the series and anime I watch and track them.

## To start
+ You need to download the frontend and backend in one folder. <br/>
  + The frontend: **https://github.com/Vadim-Savchuk/mySerialsPetProject-frontend**  <br/>
  + The backend: **https://github.com/Vadim-Savchuk/mySerilasPetProject-backand**  <br/>
+ In the terminal run the command:  <br/>
```javascript
cd server
npm run dev
```
